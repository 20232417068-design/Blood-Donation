        <h4 class="text-danger fw-bold">Who We Are</h4>
        <p>
            The Blood Donation System is a platform created to connect
            <strong>voluntary blood donors</strong> with people who urgently need blood.
            Our goal is to make the process of finding donors faster, easier, and more reliable.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-danger fw-bold mt-4">Our Mission</h4>
        <p>
            Our mission is simple — <strong>Save Lives</strong>.
            Every second, someone needs blood due to accidents, surgery, childbirth, or medical conditions.
            We bridge the gap by providing a digital platform where donors and recipients can connect instantly.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-danger fw-bold mt-4">What We Provide</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Easy donor registration</li>
            <li>✔ Quick search for blood groups</li>
            <li>✔ City-based donor filtering</li>
            <li>✔ Organized donor database for admins</li>
            <li>✔ 24/7 accessible platform</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-danger fw-bold mt-4">Why This Matters</h4>
        <p>
            Many people lose their lives simply because the right blood type wasn't found on time.
            With this system, we aim to reduce these delays and ensure that
            <strong>no life is lost due to blood shortage.</strong>
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-danger fw-bold mt-4">Our Vision</h4>
        <p>
            To build a nation-wide network of donors and inspire more people to contribute
            to this lifesaving cause.
        </p>
